My Website url:  http://fma2.github.io/

Discuss the following:
* What did you learn about design and user experience? 
* Do you like design and user experience? Was it fun working on your site, the plan, and/or the wireframe? (If you hated it, that's OK too)
* What was your process? What worked and didn't work?
* What would you like to add or change about the site next?
* Was it difficult to apply the material you learned? Did you find anything in your research you thought was super cool?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

Through the readings in this challenge, I have grown to repeat, “Design is about solving problems!”  My full-time job involves understanding, analyzing, and sometimes making policy, and it was interesting to see that the steps to design mirror steps in policy development and analysis: identify the problem, devise a plan to rectify it, implement solution, review whether it was successful.   Even much of the process for website development articulated in the readings is comparable: information gatheirng, planning, design, development, testing & delivery, maintenance.  Ensuring positive user experience of a website is not only related to how it looks but it also seems inextricably linked to understanding that its design and development must solve a problem.   

In creating my website, I first researched various websites for formats.  I considered themes for the site (a personal website, a class website, a personal/work portfolio) and looked for sites that fit these themes.  After a bit of research, I drew out a wireframe on paper and then transferred it to a wireframing application.  Then, I created the my_wireframe.html file in which I typed out pseudocode alongside a screenshot of the wireframe.  I then coded HTML first, followed by CSS.  Lastly, I edited and tested--this part took me the longest.  

Overall, I would like to make my site more responsive.  Further, I want the navigation bar to link to a corresponding title on the same page--when clicked, it should jump to that part, similar to how it does on the Girls Who Code website http://girlswhocode.com/about-us/.   The website needs to be adapted for mobile and tablet devices.  

It was difficult to apply newer material though I really wanted to--I am convinced my website is not ready for public consumption until it is made fully responsive to all devices.  Further, when I started working on the site, I was still not fully comfortable with position, floats, margin, padding, etc. tags.  I am more comfortable now but there is still room to grow; this is the reason it took me quite some time to edit and test the website.
