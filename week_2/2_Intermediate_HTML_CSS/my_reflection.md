# U1.W2: Intermediate HTML and CSS Reflection

* What do you think about web standards? Are they good or bad?
* Does the standard structure make sense to you? Why or why not?
* Do you like the new HTML5 elements, such as `<header>`, `footer`, and `nav`? Why or why not?
* Why is reset.css necessary? 
* What browsers have you used? Did you ever notice that sites looked different in different browsers? Do you think it's good or bad that they do?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

Web standards provide for consistency.  Upon reading more on the value of creating standards on the World Wide Web Consortium (http://www.w3.org/standards/about.html) website , it seems web standards are necessary and useful as long as they have been created with input from those most impacted by them.   They are necessary and useful because they provide an accessible starting point for any and all web developers to create a variety of web experiences.  

Yes, the standards structure, as described in the slides link of this challenge, makes sense to me.  I hypothesize this is because the standards structure parallels many word processing applications’ default settings.  This leads me to wonder if word processing applications’ default settings (width and sizes) are based on a standard monitor size or if it is another reason.  Either way, I am not sure if it is good or bad that the standard structure makes sense to me just because I’m used to seeing it in another computer application.

The HTML5 elements seem to allow for better organization of a HTML document.  While basic HTML tags have the potential to be organized like an essay outline, they are not as clear as the tags (<header>, <section>,) in HTML5.  Unfortunately, HTML5 could be confusing for a new developer like me due to its incompatibility with different web browsers. 

Reset.css creates a consistent baseline and controls for cross-browser differences.  Also, for a web developer, it is easier to reset  than to edit what already exists when re-styling a document--”you’re adding styles rather than removing or modifying them.  Browswer compatibility issues can be minimized” (http://www.sitepoint.com/css-resets-useful-or-useless/).  

I have used various browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Puffin, and Opera.  I have used all on different devices.  Yes, sites can look different in different browsers.  Notably, now that I understand reset.css, I finally understand why, when loading a site I used frequently a specific way, I always get an unformatted version on Chrome and not on Firefox.

Yes, I found a few resources on HTML5 that helped me better understand it:
