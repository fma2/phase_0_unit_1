# U1.W2: Responsive Design Reflection

* What is responsive web design? Do you like it?  Do you think it's a good practice? Why or why not?
* How do you think smartphones and tablets have changed web design? How do you think new technology will change web design in the future?
* How do you think visually impaired people use the web? Can they? Should we design and development for them?
* What ideas and concepts have resonated with you when learning about the web and design? What seems stupid or doesn't make sense?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

Responsive web design is the approach that suggests design and development should automatically respond to user’s preferences--the size of the screen they are using, the platform and orientation.  To do this, web developers must use flexible grids and layouts, images, and CSS media queries.   There are four types of websites in web design --fixed, fluid, adaptive, and responsive.  

First, upon learning about the approach, I finally began to notice that many of the websites I use are responsive websites.   In fact, I also realize how I have always disliked the design of a few sites I have to use for (government databases or websites)--all of which are not responsive websites.  I think, as the number and variety of devices that can access the web grows, it is only inevitable that sites become more responsive; with every site that is not, it is not as useful or impactful for the user.

Visually impaired people use the web through screen readers and special browsers.  In other words, they may need sometimes uncommon--especially in less developed parts of the world--applications to access the web.  I would argue better design and more development needs to be done for not just the visually impaired but for others with special needs.  As the slides in this challenge explain, “Accessibility is for everyone!”  There need to be alternate paths to make websites more accessible for those with special needs, and there need to be shared best practices in terms of user experience (color, captions, amount of information, etc.)

In recent years, the influx of artificial intelligence software development is inspiring.  Siri and Google Now, to name a couple of technologies, both seem to prioritize the user.  It would be interesting to see lessons learned from that software in web design and development. 

One aspect that I find frustrating in responsive web design is its inconsistency.  There are websites that are well-adapted to mobile devices, in which the user is able to access all of the same content on a mobile device as on a desktop.  And, then there are websites which adapt to mobile devices, in terms of design (i.e. no need to scroll sideways to see everything), but they are missing information or important elements.
