What is your biggest time management challenge with during Phase 0?
I'm currently working  more than 40 hours hours per week at a full-time job.  Handling the caseload from this job alongside DBC expectations and assignments is my biggest time management challenge during Phase 0.  Further, while the caseload from the job may not be new material, much of the work for DBC is--this added learning curve means that most of the hours I am not at work end up being dedicated to DBC assignments.  

How will you combat that? What techniques will you try?
I anticipate combatting this challenge will require at least two steps: (1) attending to my rhythms and (2) utilizing the pomodoro technique.  For example, if I know I am more attentive to readings in the mornings--an example of a rhythm--I can utilize this time to take care of at least one part of future challenges.  The pomodoro technique asks one to pay attention to how much effort an activity requires by monitoring how many pomodoros (25-minute time periods) it takes--if I at least begin to become aware of this, I can budget my time more effectively, eventually setting more accurate time tables according to what needs to be done, how much time I have available, and how long I expect it will take me.  

What is your overall plan for Phase 0?
My overall plan for Phase 0 is to attend to at least one challenge a day, utilizing the pomodoro technique and my rhythms to manage time more reasonably.  Whether I complete the technical aspects of the challenge or not on that specific day, I intend to reflect on it and take notes on next steps or new learnings.  I hope to include meditation on my process as part of this reflection, as I am convinced these extra steps have made an impact when I previously had trouble understanding a concept (and, before reflecting, spent too much time trying to fix something that I should have just stepped away from and retried later).
