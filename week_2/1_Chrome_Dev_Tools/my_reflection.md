# U1.W2: Chrome Dev Tools Challenge Reflection

* Describe the Document Object Model? What about it makes sense to you? What doesn't? What seems good and bad about it?
* How did using Chrome Web Tools to look at your site and a wordpress.com site compare?
* Did you find Chrome Web Tools fun, helpful, or a pain to work with?
* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

The Document Object Model is a programming interface which “allows programs and scripts to dynamically access and update the content, structure and style of documents” (http://www.w3.org/DOM/).  In other words, a web page, as a document with HTML, CSS, and scripting language, can be viewed and adapted through the DOM interface.  

In a practical sense, the DOM makes sense as an interesting tool--I appreciate that it exists, as it aids in my growing understanding of HTML and CSS.  In a conceptual sense, I have a hard time wrapping my head around how it works--I feel I am missing an understanding of important computer science vocabulary to fully comprehend the information presented in this challenge’s readings.  

The DOM seems useful, as it allows for better understanding of a website--for web developers who seek to make a website load faster, the DOM is a simple tool to use.  Notably, when I used DevTools on Chrome, I found that it took HTML5 tags and turned them into HTML tags; this may be of concern for developers who would like to use DevTools to manipulate their site without changing their specific tags/text.  

One main difference I found in looking at wordpress.com sites as compared to my site is javascript. Since I am not able to use scripting languages, my site does not have any javascript.  I also have fewer items to load on my site.  

I found Chrome Web Tools to be fun to work with.  There seem to be some limitations to the tool (saving one’s work, for exampl), but, with my limited use, these did not cause any problems for me.  

I was previously having trouble linking an external CSS file to my HTML files from week 1, and it turns out I had the syntax wrong.  Using Chrome Web Tools made me realize this--I was able to see multiple examples of good code with the help of it.
