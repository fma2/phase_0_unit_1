## 3. [Web Basics](3_web_basics/readme.md) Reflection

* What 2 new things did you learn about the web?
* What are some important things to remember when setting up your HTML site?
* How did you feel when you saw your web page live?
* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

I learned--
1. The difference between a web page and a web application.  In fact, the after completing this challenge, I had an opportunity to explain this to a coworker who was having trouble printing information from a web app.  
2. The role of clients, networks, and servers in making the internet work. 

It is important to consider a few standards when setting up a HTML side.   These have to do with the HTML, CSS, and Javascript code, accessibility, semantics, meta data, and character encoding.  Further, HTML functions on the client-side of the internet.  

I was excited to see my web page live!  I have only made websites through WYSIWYG tools and have been frustrated with their limitations.  For this site, though incredibly simple, I appreciated reflecting on its process: it went from text editor to Github to web!

An “aha” moment was understanding the different languages on the client-side and server-side of the web.  I am familiar with the names of all of the languages in “Intro to Web Concepts” GirlDevelopIt slides, but I did fully comprehend they functioned on different levels.  Also, I was impressed to see that a web team requires so many individuals from the front end to the back end to overall.

I was having trouble understanding how DNS works and needed more visuals.  I was happy to  find the following:
