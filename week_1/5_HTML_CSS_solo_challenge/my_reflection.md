* Did you learn any new skills or tricks?
* How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies for this challenge? 
* Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy?
* Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?

Similar to Challenge 4, I was again interested in positioning through CSS.  I utilized the provided HTML/CSS resource (http://learn.shayhowe.com/) for tips.  While I was able to figure out how to position information on my solo challenge web page, I do not think I would be able to immediately apply these learnings to a new page.  I would again have to experiment with margin and padding px and  fixed/relative/etc. positioning.  From this challenge, however, I did grow comfortable with the syntax of Div IDs and classes.

Regarding the Learning Competencies, I am more confident with using HTML tags to present information on a website.  These tags are repetitive and simple--I would, however, like to become familiar with tags I did not use and am not aware of.  Regarding CSS padding, borders, and margins, I am confident with their syntax but not completely confident I would be able to make quick decisions on these in another website without testing what each looks like.
I enjoyed figuring out parts after working for a while on them--specifically, when I figured out how to effectively create a sidebar.  I did not have prepare myself with material/content to include on the page, so I found it tedious to have to come up with information to include while also trying to code.  In the future, I hope to prepare the content in advance.
