## 2. [Open Source and Repo Setup](2_set_up_repo/readme.md) Reflection

* Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person
* Describe what open source means
* What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
* Assess the importance of using licenses
* What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

To create a repository on Github, one must first have a Github account.  When logged in, they select “Create Repository” and complete the form: provide a name for the repository, decide if its private or public, include a readme file, and select a license, if any.  At this points, this repository will exist on the web.  In order to get it on your local computer, you must clone it.  For this, you need the Github app on your computer.  Open the app and login.  When you login, you will see a list of repositories.  With the repository you would like to clone, select “Clone to Computer.”  Then, celebrate!

Open source software means information on how a program was made is shared.  In contrast, with programs that are not open source, the public only has access to its output.  Open source permits anyone to adapt the program

I think Open Source is excellent, especially now that I know how Github works with its branches and merging capabilities.  It does not make me nervous or protective, but I think this is, in part, because I have not written any code that anyone would deem valuable.  With this in mind, I can understand why Open Source may make some nervous or protective.

Similarly, using licenses is critical.  Because a license “grants specific permissions for others to use that work” (http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/03/24/a-short-guide-to-open-source-and-similar-licenses/), it controls for misuse, according to the owner of the code’s needs.  Using license with Open Source code still allows for others to build on and share the code but also regulates extreme abuses or issues.  

I did not fully understand “Open Source” prior to this challenge. I envisioned it was a free-for-all without any sort of regulation--I found it interesting to see that not only were there licenses, there are a multiple license options.  I struggled with motivating myself to read the fineprint on each of the types of licenses--i.e. what it allows, what it doesn’t allow, etc.  I believe this is because I am not making any important decisions about any code I have written.  It’s hard to attend to the details on each license because I am not personally impacted by them.

I was glad to find a list of the “Top 20 Open Source Licenses” (http://www.blackducksoftware.com/resources/data/top-20-open-source-licenses), as it made me consider why one might select each.
