Reflect on the process of researching and writing a blog post. It doesn't have to be long. Did you enjoy this? Did you get comments or views? Did you find the blog helpful to your learning? Did you find it cumbersome? Which parts did you feel best about and which did you feel less certain about?

I brought back an old blog I started years ago for this challenge.  It was meant to be a food blog, for which I only submitted a few entries when I began it.  Because I spent so much time on creating the page for Github site, I used the text from the Github page though it has nothing to do with food.  The blog post was not incredibly helpful to my learning; creating the page for my Github site  was helpful, as it was newer, more interesting information.
