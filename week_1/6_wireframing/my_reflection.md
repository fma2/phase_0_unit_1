## 6. [Wireframing](6_wireframing/readme.md) Reflection

* * What did you learn about design and user experience? 
* Do you like design and user experience? Was it fun working on your site, the plan, and/or the wireframe? (If you hated it, that's OK too)

* What questions did you ask during this challnge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?  
* What concepts are you having trouble with, or did you just figure something out? If so, what?  
* Did you learn any new skills or tricks?
* How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies for this challenge? 
* Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy?
* Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?

I learned that website/web page design and user experience must be purposeful.  It is useful to consider backwards design in creating a website.  What the user should experience and how the design can support this are important considerations.  

I like thinking about and assessing websites according to design and user experience.  I find I am incredibly critical of websites that seem cluttered; for example, many news sites have too many components like articles, sections, social media links, advertisements, and much more.  It was interesting to think about how websites can actually not be cluttered even if there is text all over, because these websites really only have a few components  (e.g. Google Drive).

Now, making my own website was not an easy task.  In wanting a simple design, I spent more time than I would like to admit selecting colors and font and setting up positions.  Luckily, my site did not require many components; otherwise, I know it would have taken me even longer.  

During the challenge, I wondered if there were any applications I had used in the past that allowed me to do wireframing, and I was happy to find that Lucid Charts does. 

I was having trouble with pushing work from the Github app to my Github page (my changes  did not appear) until I realized that I had created a separate branch, which I had been working on for quite a bit of time.  Once I figured this out, I had to merge the two branches and the problem was solved.  This was a major relief.  

I am fairly confident with the Learning Competencies for this challenge.  I believe I can explain wireframing and its usefulness.  I can also wireframe existing websites.  

I enjoyed wireframing the web pages I selected.  I found writing about the websites to be somewhat tedious but still useful.
