## 1. [Git and Github](1_get_started/readme.md) Reflection

* What struggles did you have setting up git and GitHub? What did you learn in the process?
* Write an explanation of and compare git and GitHub to a non-technical audience. 
* Describe what version control is and how GitHub helps with it.
* Why do developers use version control (git)? Does that make sense to you? Why or why not?
* What doesn't make sense? What does?

It was not difficult to set up git and GitHub with the directions provided.   However, while following the directions, I could not fully visualize how each step connected or the results of the process.  Specifically, I am having trouble comprehending the connection between the command line and git/Github, and I anticipate I will need to research this further.  

Git functions on the command line and allows one to keep track of changing versions of code while working on it.  Github operates from a web browser.  Git is not remotely accessible, while Github is remotely accessible.  Information from git is pushed to Github.  

Version control keeps track of code while it is still being worked on.  One can use Git, one of numerous version control systems, to look at snapshots of code to see its progress and/or changes as it was worked on.  This makes sense to me, as it is helpful in multiple ways.  Someone who is working on a piece of code can use previous snapshots of the same code to ensure he/she is on the right track or to check for bugs or anything they have missed/need.  Someone who is looking at another individualâ€™s code can learn from the progress and/or changes seen in the different versions.
