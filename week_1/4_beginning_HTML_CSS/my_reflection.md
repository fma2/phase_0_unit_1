## 4.[Beginning HTML and CSS](4_beginning_HTML_CSS/readme.mc) Reflection

* What makes sense to your about HTML? What doesn't? 
* What seems good and bad about HTML?
* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

HTML is repetitive.  And, any design element started must be closed.  I found most aspects of HTML to be fairly clear; I only had trouble externally linking the CSS file I created--I do not think I did this correctly though I tried multiple times.

HTML is limited, it seems.  It would not be my first or only choice to make an interactive website.  It creates fairly flat websites.  I tried to make my wireframing and technical blog sites more interesting with positioning--it took me several attempts to figure out how to make the body text disappear into the header while scrolling.  

In the past, I have created websites through WYSIWYG applications/tools.  Through them, I never had to create a sidebar or understand positioning of header, body, footer.  How these items come to appear on certain parts of the page became much clearer through this challenge.

I used various pages on  www.w3schools.com quite a bit--as it was usually the first search result when querying Google.  For colors, this page was particularly useful: http://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_colorpicker.asp
