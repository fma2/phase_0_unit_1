Take a moment to reflect on reading other people's responses regarding their fears about DBC. How did that make you feel? Did you feel better, worse, or something else all together? How has your experience this week influenced your feelings? All feelings are welcome and ok. Just take a moment to think about it and write it down.

I felt better seeing that others had to look for additional resources to assist them with their work.  

I am still looking forward to DBC, but I realized this week that, during Phase 0, I will need to better balance the demands of my full-time job with the demands of DBC work.
